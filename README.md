# Crowdfunding Data Analysis
## Overview
This repository contains code for an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) mini project where we built an ETL pipeline using Python and Pandas. We extracted and transformed the data, created four CSV files, created an ERD and Table Schema, and uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
# Prerequisites   
We used the following dependencies 
* pandas
* numpy

# Steps
* Import dependencies

* Extract Crowdfunding Data by reading the data into a Pandas DataFrame

* Create category and subcategory DataFrames

* Create campaign dataframe

* Extract Contacts Data 

* Create Contacts DataFrame

* Create an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) using QuickDBD.

* Create a table schema for each CSV file 

* Specify types in schema

* Saved the dtabase schema as a Postgres file named crowdfunding_db_schema.sql

* Created a new Postgres database called crowdfunding_db

* Used a Select statement to verify data
